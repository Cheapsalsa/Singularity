# Singularity - 48-Hour Game Jam Title

DISCLAIMER: This is 48-Hour Game Jam style code. It is messy and clunked together in order to meet the two day deadline.

4-player co-op versus game featuring a space theme and a KOTH gamemode. Made with Python and PyGame

Special thanks to Carlos Hernandez for his work with me during the Game Jam. (Shawnee State University GDOS GameJam)

Requires Pygame to run "cmd pip install Pygame" + Xbox 360 Controllers
- Note: has currently been left in a development state in favor of the Unity5 reboot "Beyond Critical".

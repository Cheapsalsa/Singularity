Hey man, got the project as far as I could. I got sleepy and ran out of snacks XD
I'll be available via messenger from 12:00 - 5:00 pm but won't be back in the ATC until my family leaves town.
See if you can't get the two controllers moving both players around seperately and shooting some primative, those
are the most important things that still need done. If we get that then we'll at least have a game of sorts.

Singularity ~ KOTH Power Struggle
' First player to reach a critical mass explodes, their for killing themselves, and winning the game. '
' Players can expend some of their mass to excrete projectiles that push the other player off course.'

Notes:
' The larger your mass, the slower you move and the larger your projectiles are, they are also more costly.'
' The smaller your mass, the faster you move and the less your projectiles cost.'
' There will be random mini singularity spawns.'
' Both players can farm the middle singularity at the same time.'
' Two player, GamePad controlers. Press A to shoot, Left Stick to move, Right Stick to aim.'
' Projectiles can collide, Players can collide, Players and Projectiles can collide.'
' Collisions reverse movement proportional to the mass of the object.'

TO-DO (Most Important to Least):

- Joystick movement and aiming input for both players.
	- aiming indicatior for both players (maybe a rotating chevron?)

- Physics objects, rectangles that shoot out of the player.
	- mass deduction for shooting.
	- they stick around a while and you have to push them out of the way.

- Ending explosion effect + winner screen.
	- end while loop and flag

- Game balance.

- Edge of screen player bounding.

- Music and sound effects.
